		<p>Jeremiah: Where did you grow up?</p>
		<p>Tanishia: I grew up in Inglewood, California just on the other side of LA.</p>
		<p>Jeremiah: What was your childhood like?</p>
		<p>Tanishia: That's interesting. My childhood was very fun. I spent a lot of my time with my grandparents because my mom she had this very demanding job. She worked for the LA Stock Exchange so sometimes she had to go to work at 3 o’clock in the morning. So, myself and your uncle would either go to work with her and sleep in the conference room or we would stay with your great grandparents. 
		</p>
		<p>Jeremiah: What is your ethnic background?</p>
		<p>Tanishia: I am african american. However, my grandfather on my dads side, he is native american and black. So, I also have native american in myself and on your grandmother's side I also have caucasian. 
		</p>
		<p>Jeremiah: Where is your mom’s family from?</p>
		<p>Tanishia: My mom’s family is from Collins Taterville Mississippi, down south.</p>
		<p>Jeremiah: Where is your dad’s family from?</p>
		<p>Tanishia: My dad’s family is from Tennessee and Arkansa and just outside of the Indian reservation in Oklahoma.</p>
		<p>Jeremiah: Have you ever been there?</p>
		<p>Tanishia: I’ve been to Oklahoma when I was younger, stayed there.</p>
		<p>Tanishia: It was interesting. Simply because I’ve never been on a plantation before. I’ve never been to the country before and to see that for the first time was very eye opening. I fell in love with the nature of the south, with the beautiful trees and the green grass but I just couldn’t deal with the heat. I think it's good to know that our family owned land and back then african americans couldn’t own land and to find out that we owned over a hundred acres of land was wonderful and that both of my great grandfathers were prominent figures in the community.
		</p> over the summer and then I’ve also visited Mississippi on two separate occasions. But, I didn’t like it because of the heat.</p>
		<p>Jeremiah: What was that experience like?</p>
		<p>Jeremiah: What are the most important lessons you’ve learned in life and where did these events happen?
		</p>
		<p>Tanishia:  The most important lessons I’ve learned in life is to keep god first no matter  what because whatever you’re going through he will always be there for you. Keep family second and always show love and compassion. I’ve learned that not just from my upbringing with my mom and my dad but also from my grandmothers, my grandfather's, my aunts and my uncles family.
		</p>
		<p>Jeremiah: How has your life been different that from what you’d imagine?</p>
		<p>Tanishia: I have kids! I never wanted kids. I had made a vowels to myself when I went into teaching over 20 years ago that I would not have kids because teaching is a tough job and I just couldn’t see myself giving all my time and energy to someone else’s kid during the day and then have to come home and do the same for my family. I mean of course my views have changed. I now have three amazing kids who gets on my nerves sometimes like all kids do, you know and it's been a blessing. I wouldn’t change it. Now what I would change is going into the teaching profession because it use to be rewarding but unfortunately it isn't anymore. Simply because there's too many politics in education so teachers aren’t allowed to teach. They have to teach towards a test and I’m against that philosophy. 
		</p>
		<p>Jeremiah: What is one moment in history that you personally remember and why?</p>
		<p>Tanishia: I remember in 2007, I took a trip with my mom down to Savannah, Georgia and that was a very heartfelt time to have to see how black people were treated and still are treated. To have to go to the barrel sights of slaves. To be able to witness a moment of history in 2007 when we think that racism is over, its not and its 2018. So, that's unsettling.

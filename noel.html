		<h2>How I started?</h2>
			<p>	I got into photography around the age of seven. I loved taking pictures of everything, especially nature because it just was so beautiful and it always caught the corner of my eye. To answer the question of “How do I become a photographer?” it is to just simply start taking pictures. It doesn’t matter what age or how small or big you are. Photography is for everyone. 
			</p>
		<h2>Joseph Nicephore Niepce</h2>
			<p> Joseph Nicephore Niepce was the first person to capture and produce a permanent image using a portable camera obscura, which is a device without lens but with a very small hole is sometimes referred to as a “pinhole camera.”(Liz Masoner 10/02/17) After his success with capturing the first permanent image it lead to other things like daguerreotype, emulsion plates,  and wet plates which were developed in the mid- to- late 1800s. 
			</p>
		<h3>Daguerreotype</h3>
			<p>A photographic process employing an iodine-sensitized silvered plate and mercury vapor is a daguerreotype. Niepce collaborated with Louis Daguerre on the daguerreotype to create a modern film. Daguerreotype had to be exposed to light for at least 15 minutes for and image to be created. The daguerreotype was replaced by emulsion plates in the late 1850s, they weren’t as popular after this.

		<h3>Emulsion Plates</h3>
			</div>
			<p>When emulsion plates first came out they were inexpensive compared to the daguerreotype. The emulsion plates were more suited for portrait photography; “wet plates used a emulsion process called the Collodion process.” Collodion process was invented by Frederick Scott in 1851. For this process you had to combine soluble iodide to cellulose nitrate. Then coating a glass plate with the mixture.

			<h3>Dry Plates</h3>
			<p> Then something new came along in the 1870s, which were dry plates. Dry plates, gelatin process, is an improved photographic plate. In 1871, Richard L. Maddox invented dry plates. Dry plates allowed more freedom in photography (taking photographs). At this time, cameras were able to be handled easier and were much smaller so they can be hand held. But then in the 1880s the rise of a camera with a mechanical shutter changed the world we live in today.

		<h3>Kodak</h3>
		<p>In the 1880s a guy named George Eastman started a photography/camera company called Kodak. A flexible roll plate was created so you wouldn’t have to change the solid plates.  New changes to the camera era was that this camera had “small single lens with no focusing adjustments.” (Liz Masoner 2017) However took the pictures they would have to take the picture to a factory so that the pictures can be developed and printed out. 
		</p>
		<p>In the 1850s cameras started to be in different countries a year after it was invented in France. Daguerreotype cameras started to be in Calcutta, which is a city in India. In 1854, the first photographic societies of India were found in Bombay. “The photographic societies greatly contributed to familiarize the theory and practice of photography. In 1856 Dr. Alexander Hunter of the Madras School of Industrial Art did useful work.”(Raja Deendayal Foundation 2004-2014).

		<h3>Color Photography</h3>
		<p>The media capable of reproducing colors is called color photography. The way color photography works is that when “electronic light sensors record color information at the time of the exposure.” Red, green, and blue lights were mixed to reproduce the original colors by using the recorded information. “Monochrome images which have been colorized by tinting selected areas by hand or mechanically or with the aid of a computer are colored photographs, not color photographs. Their colors are not dependent on the actual colors of the objects photographed and may be very inaccurate or completely arbitrary.”(Coote, Jack 1993).

		<div id='Digital Photography'>
		<h2>Digital Photography</h2>
		</div>
		<p>Digital photography started to come alive around like the 1950s. In 1952 the first video tape recorders were used to record TV programs. Before this, most television was either live, or was a broadcast movie. A coded video signal was recorded with an video tape. Later the “coded tape was run through a decoding machine (i.e. a video tape player) and the machine converted the coded signal back into pictures.”(Darrell Payne 2015).

		<div id='The Space Race'>
		<h2>The Space Race</h2>
		</div>
		<p>Have you ever heard of the space race? The space race was a competition between the Soviet Union and United States. The space race plays an enormous part in today’s digital photography.  “The space race was very important to digital photography because politicians on both sides of the cold war realized that if a satellite could be launched into space it could carry a camera. With a camera on board it could spy on the enemy.” (Darrell Payne 2016) There was a problem because there is no way there is a film developer in space. Because of this issue that’s how digital cameras came along an apart of our society.

		<p>In 2000, many digital camera’s had been developed by electronics and computer companies. “Nikon forced the major players to re-evaluate their stance on digital imaging and in the early 2000’s the pixel race began.”(Jason Row 2012).
		</p>
		<p>In 2000, the camera company Canon, announced the D30, which was a consumer level 3.1mp camera that brought DSLR’s within the range of non professionals for the first time. “By 2003 the other major players in photography had all introduced DSLRs.”(Jason Row 2012) There were also other types of cameras like: bridge cameras, DSLR style cameras, CMOS sensors as opposed to CCDs, new memory cards such as SD and XD and to store digital images and video footage.
